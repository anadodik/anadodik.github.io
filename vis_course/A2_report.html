			<h2>Subtheme: Visualizing exclusionary zoning</h2>

			This dataset represents the geographic, demographic and zoning information of different municipalities of the Boston Metropolitan Area. 
			The residential zones of each municipality are grouped into single-family, and non-single family zones.
			Therefore, there are at most two entries per municipality in the database.
			For each municipality, we are also given the percentage of residential land that is dedicated to single family housing.
			For each zoning group are given demographic data: race, binarized gender, age group, and income bracket per household.
			We are also given aggregate statistics on how many people live in a household and whether they are a family or not.
			
			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>

			<ol>
				<li>
					How does wealth distribution relate to living in single family areas? 
					Are rich people more likely to live in those areas? 
					My assumption is that rich people have the monetary incentive to prevent single-family areas from being up-zoned.
				</li>
				<li>
					Do single-family zones actually house single families?
					Needing a roommate likely correlates with lower income.
					Assuming no class-segregation, we would expect as many roommates in single-family zones as in non-single family zones.
					Which zones are more likely to house roommates?
					Are single family zones another way to class-segretate society? 
				</li>
				<li>
					The G.I. Bill from 1944 famously allowed for discrimination against black people when it came to home purchases.
					This prevented black people from moving to predominantly white suburbs.
					Combined with other discriminatory practices, such as jim crow laws and redlining, racial segregation remains strong.
					Does it show up in this dataset? Are single-family zoned suburbs still segregated?
				</li>
				<li>
					What are the age demographics of the single-family zones?
					Baby-boomers hold most of the economic power in the country,
					and would therefore logically be the most likely to be able to afford to live in a single-family house.
				</li>

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>

			
			Immediately it became obvious that some of the fields are per-zone and some per-municipality.
			For example, naively computing <code>SUM(%single family)</code> results in values that go up to 200% if we're aggregating per municipality.
			Therefore if we are plotting things per municipality, <code>AVG</code> is the more appropriate operator.
			With that in mind, we can visualize the percent of single-family housing in each municipality.
			<figure>
				<img style="max-width:100%;" src="./images/Where_are_the_single_family_zones.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				The more deep-blue a value is, the more single-family zoned area there is in the municipality.
				I am a bit surprised by this: I would have expected the single-family zones to be suburbs, i.e. the furthest from the city.
				Reflecting on the distance of these suburbs, it might make sense because areas like Newton are still suburbs but within driving distance from Boston.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			Time to move onto my question 1: are single-family zoned areas rich.
			For this purpose I will define "rich" as income over $200k per household, even though that is far from rich according to Boston's living standards.
			However, this is the best we can do with the data given.
			We can also create two groups in Tableau based on the <code>Only Single Family</code> attribute.
			<figure>
				<img style="max-width:100%;" src="./images/Are_Single_Family_Areas_Rich_1.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Here we have performed two simple dot plots and overlayed a box-and-whiskers plot.
				The x-axis represents the percentage of people with income over $200k and is shared between the plots.
				The top plot shows non single family zones and the bottom plot shows single family zones.
				There really does appear to be a discrepancy between the two, but there is some definite uncertainty in there.
				Note: I made the dot-plot horizontal instead of the default vertical, because then the box-and-whiskers plot looks like a highlighter with the correct color choice.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img style="max-width:100%;" src="./images/Are_Single_Family_Areas_Rich_2.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Here we've included color to encode the percentage of single-family zoned area in a municipality.
				This reveals a really interesting trend!
				For those living in a single family zoned neighborhood, 
				if their neighborhood is predominantly single-family zoned, they are more likely to be rich.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			This poses the question, are there discrepancies within municipalities. 
			E.g. if we take a look at a municipality which has both single family zoned areas and not single-family zoned areas, 
			how do the incomes compare?
			<figure>
				<img style="max-width:100%;" src="./images/Are_Single_Family_Areas_Rich_3.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Hand-picking a couple of municipalities which I've noticed appear in both, and there seems to be a trend.
				Does this trens hold in general? We should check this more rigorously.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			We can make this more general by creating a filter in Tableau.
			<figure>
				<img style="max-width:100%;" src="./images/Are_Single_Family_Areas_Rich_4.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				The trend really does seem to hold in general!
				For single-family zoned municipalities, it seems they cannot be at the same time rich and have a small percentage of single-family zoned housing.
				It seems there is a definite correlation between single-family housing and rich people.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			We can represent this as a bar chart and sort by sum number of people with income over $200k.
			<figure>
				<img style="max-width:100%;" src="./images/Are_Single_Family_Areas_Rich_5.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				This visualization seems very cluttered.
				A good idea might be to either separate them into groups like in previous plots, or to simply plot the difference between the single-family and non-single-family and sort that.
				I will leave this for future work as it doesn't seem like it would add anything particular.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			We can draw multiple conclusions from this.
			One would be that living in a single-family housing somehow incentivizes everyone in it to become rich.
			This is highly unlikely.
			Another is that it is necessary to be rich to be able to afford living in such a neighborhood.
			This would imply that there are entire neighborhoods of Boston that are completely class-segregated.
			Why is our society okay with class-based segregation, but is appalled by race-based segregation?

			Regardless, let's move onto question 2: race.
			We can start by visualizing where non-white vs. white people live.
			<figure>
				<img style="max-width:100%;" src="./images/Where_Do_White_People_Live.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					Percent of the population that is non-white.
					The color map seems to be chosen such that white represents the percentage of the white population.
					Comparing it to Figure 1, nothing seems to immediately pop out.
					Maybe a choropleth is the wrong visualization.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			In the end, we are trying to find a correlation between race and preference for single-family zoned housing.
			Scatter-plots are usually good at showing correlations: we can try plotting the percentage of a given race vs. the percentage of single-family area.
			
			<figure>
				<img style="max-width:100%;" src="./images/Where_Do_White_People_Live_2.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Again, this is not particularly revealing to me.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			We will try again the visualization from Figure 4.
			<figure>
				<img style="max-width:100%;" src="./images/Where_Do_White_People_Live_4.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					Plotting the percentage of non-white to white people on the x-axis, and separating the residential zones into two groups, we can see a definite pattern.
					The single family zones are clustered much more highly to the right, indicating a lower variance in the population.
					There is also definitely something to be said about the box-and-whiskers plot deciding non-white areas are outliers in our data :)
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			We can now try combining the visualizations from Figure 4 the last figure.
			What if we combine zoning, income, and race?
			<figure>
				<img style="max-width:100%;" src="./images/Where_Do_White_People_Live_3.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				We plot the percentage of rich people on the shared x-axis, like in Figure 4.
				However, unlike Figure 4, the colormap here indicates the percentage of non-white people.
				Not only are single-family zoned areas richer, it seems that, the richer and more single-family an area is, the less likely it is to be non-white.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			We proceed to our last quesiton.
			There is a financially dominant group in the United States of America, the baby boomers.
			If we expect single-family zoning to be a class and race issue, we would expect to see them over-represented in single-family zones.
			We will simply repeat the same analysis on as with non-white people.
			<figure>
				<img style="max-width:100%;" src="./images/Where_Do_Old_People_Live_1.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					We plot a choropleth of the percentage of the 65+ population.
					The colorscale is chosen such that white (the color of gray hair) indicates a higher population of older people.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			Again, the choropleth is not very revealing.
			<figure>
				<img style="max-width:100%;" src="./images/Where_Do_Old_People_Live_3.png" alt="" />
				<img style="max-width:100%;" src="./images/Where_Do_Old_People_Live_2.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					The top Figure plots the percentage of people with that are 65+ on the x-axis, and the same value in color.
					The bottom Figure plots the percentage of rich people on the x-axis, but retains the age demographics data in the color.
					Again we see a similar correlation between high-income single-family areas, and an aging population.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p>
				In summary, I learned that a choropleth might not be a super useful visualization for the type of analysis I am trying to perform.
				I found it extremely useful to separate out the data into groups and to encode things in both the position and color dimensions.
				Regarding the data itself, it seems to confirm my original hypothesis.
				The people living in single-family zones are more often higher-income, white, and over 65+.
				Certainly, this is a population with a lot of privilege and power in our society.
				Lastly, what I presented here was insightflu, but still a very surface-level analysis.
				For example, it will be necessary to analyze other income brackets as well.
