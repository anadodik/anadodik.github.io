    <h2>Proposition: regardless of the ethnicity of the member of service, NYPD has a disproportionate number of complaints from black people.</h2>

      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
				<img style="max-width:100%;" src="Ernest.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					Percentage of incidents grouped by the ethnicity of the member of service in NYC.
					The percentage of incidents reported by black people is higher than any other individual ethnicity,
					regardless of the ethnicity of the NYPD member of service.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					The most important decision in both the visualizations is over what dimension the data is normalized.
					In this visualization, I opted for a visualization that is more directly related to the proposition:
					first I separated the data into groups based on the MOS ethnicity, and then plotted the percentage
					of complaints from different complaintant ethnicities <i>within</i> each MOS ethnicity. 
					Earnestness score: 2.
				</li>
				<li>
					Within each plot, I decided to put the largest group at the top because our eyes culturally start at the top and move down.
					That group is black people and it clearly stands out as the largest group in each category.
					I considered separating the plots into individual bar charts, but because it is percentages and
					because I wanted the majority group to stand out, this seemed like the most succinct form.
					I am lowering the earnestness score on this one because I manually reordered the data to make a point instead of
					sorting it alphabetically or going with a random ordering.
					Earnestness score: 1.5.
				</li>
				<li>
					The caption of the rows is intentionally wordy as a way of giving the reader more information, and therefore trust in the visualization.
					On one hand, what I wrote down is true, but I did write it down intentionally trying project the image of trustworthyness.
					Earnestness score: 1.5.
				</li>
			</ul>

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
		<img style="max-width:100%;" src="Deceptive.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
          			NYPD officers are significantly more likely to have more complaints if they are white, regardless of the race of the complaintant.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					As mentioned, the major difference between the visualizations is normalization.
					Within each ethnicity complaintant ethnicity, white MOS have more complaints.
					Therefore, black people are affected <i>more</i> by white NYPD MOS,
					seemingly contradicting the initial statement.
					Of course, this is likely because there are simply more white MOS in the NYPD,
					but that information is not actually available in our dataset.
					We would have to collect additional data or rely on priors about the world to know that.
					Our dataset only contains information on the <i>number of complaints per MOS ethnicity</i>.
					If there is an equal number of MOS of each ethnicity, this visualization would be perfectly earnest.
					Earnestness score: -0.5.
				</li>
				<li>
					The visualization is intentionally busy for two reasons: 
					it makes it seem more trustworthy because it seems like more science has been done,
					while simultaneously making it harder to reason about deeply.
					Earnestness score: -1.5.
				</li>
				<li>
					The label on the bottom was made intentionally more vague than in the first visualization.
					I considered making it say "Percentage Incidents (Normalized within Complaintant Ethnicity)",
					but felt like that would make the faults in the visualization more obvious.
					Earnestness score: -2.0.
				</li>
			</ul>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>
		I found it interesting that I used the same data for both visualizations and made it say very different things,
		just by using different statistical tools and flipping axes around.
		Even my Tableau formulas used were nearly identical!
		I wonder which visualization I would have come up with if I had to make just one, and if
		I did not already have a preconcieved notion of what I was expecting to see.
		This assignment really shines a new light on the statement "just follow the data", which we so often see online.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		More interestingly, I would argue that both visualizations might be considered earnest if this dataset is all we know about.
		If someone with no prior knowledge on the NYPD looked at the second visualization, they might conclude that it is reasonably earnest.
		There is also something to be said about the connection between cognitive load and earnestness.
		I am someone who works  with data and statistics, and I feel like it would take me some time to notice what the problem with the second visualization is.
		It is possible that someone with less training or someone looking to justify their bias would be more likely to just accept the visualization for what it is.
