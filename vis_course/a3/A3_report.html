			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>

			For this visualization, I wanted to look into how the age demographics of the US changed over time.
			I have heard that some developed nations have aging populations, so it would be interesing to see this pattern in the data.

	      	<figure>
				<img style="max-width:100%;" src="sketch1.jpg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					Percentage of people over the age of 60 between the years 1900 and 2000.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Since we want to explore whether the population is aging,
					my initial idea was to simply plot the percentage of the population over the age of 60+, between 1900 and 2000.
				</li>
				<li>
					The plot is intentionally simple as it is trying to communicate a simple idea: 
					percentage of population over the age of 60 is going up. 
				</li>
				<li>
					The space above the line graph is left intentionally blank. 
					The part of the population does not matter for the message the visualization is trying to convey.
					Instead, all the graph is, is an area going up and to the left, with a label directly inside of the shaded area.
					It is immediate, clear and concise.
				</li>
			</ul>

      		<figure>
				<img style="max-width:100%;" src="sketch2.jpg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					Percentage population of different age groups.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					I dislike that the first visualization singled out people from one group, and erased people from another.
					Therefore, I tried to make a visualization that represented all age groups.
				</li>
				<li>
					The groups were now sorted so that the age increases with the percentages on the axis. 
					Hopefully introduces some redundancy gain into the visualization in that numbers go up in the same direction.
				</li>
				<li>
					Again the graph has been left intentionally sparsely populated.
					The goal is not to give the exact statistics to the reader, rather a global overview of trends.
				</li>
			</ul>

      <figure>
				<img style="max-width:100%;" src="sketch3.jpg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					Life gained. Final visualization, focusing on the years of lives that were lived due to improvements in life quality and expectancy.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					I felt like the previous visualization was more fair to different age groups, 
					but I felt like it completely lost any message it might have had.
					For this I wanted to focus on one affective goal:
					the improved life expectancy and the human lives that comes with it.
				</li>
				<li>
					A major change was to show the difference in the absolute number of people in each group between 1900 and 2000.
					Focusing on this difference allows us to focus on what we have gained: many years of many human lives.
					This is emphasized again with the main caption of the figure, which has been moved to the side: "Human life gained."
				</li>
				<li>
					I have decided to strip away everything else from the chart.
					There will be two statistics: population in 1900 and the population in 2000.
					This might go against best practices, but I am going for a highly affective data visceralization.
				</li>
			</ul>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
		For my first design, I wanted to convey a simple statistical truth,
		but in making the design, I was reminded of the humanity of the people that were being represented by the data.
        Thinking about my affective goals, I am not sure that I was not inadvertenly conveying something I would have rather not conveyed.
		As mentioned, I felt like the decision to single out a specific population was loud in a way I did not like.
		So I tried to make it more "fair" and represent all groups equally, but that left me with a fairly bland visualization.
		Thinking about what I am communicating, I realized that, while the population might be aging percentage-wise,
		that is partially due to longer life expectancy.
		By normalizing the data into percentages, I was erasing individual humans who got to live longer lives.
		So I decided to focus on one fact: longer life expectancy leads to more cumulative time humans get to spend on this Earth.

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

			<p>
        		After I began designing the chart, it immediately became clear to me that the data was not between 1900 and 2000,
				but rather just for those two years.
				Despite looking at the .csv file, I had not noticed this previously.
				
				I decided to keep the original designs even though they are now much more aggregate.
				The reasoning behind this was that it gives an immediate visual impression of something growing.
				I decided that the arrow on the right hand side should also only point upwards for the same reason (unlike the hand-drawn design):
				population is moving towards where the arrow is pointing.

				Again, the only numbers being conveyed are in a annotation: we are going for a pathos-heavy visualization.
				Subtracting the population in 1900 such that the chart starts at 0 goes against commonly touted norms,
				but artisticly matches the message better: we want to focus on the gain, not the numbers.
				Again, idea is emphasized in the main caption which now additionally contains the word "human" in it.

				The colors were chosen to be soft and pastel, but I did not try to assign them any meaning as we were warned against that in the lecture.
				I chose an area chart because I felt like it corresponded to the <i>mass</i> of people that it was representing.
				In an attempt to focus on the message, I removed all of the axes, and put the legend directly into the chart.

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        Phase 1 was incredibly helpful in the final design.
		For one, the question I wanted to answer completely changed and I decided to focus on a positive aspect of the data.
		Morevoer, I came up with a design that was really difficult to do in Tableau.
		It required duplicate axes, calculated fields, manually changing the axes ranges, significantly changing the default formatting, etc.
		I could not find out how to make the arrow with the main caption of "Human life gained." in Tableau, so I had to resort to Adobe Illustrator for that.
		Had I started off with Tableau, I would have likely been steered away from such a visualization and settled on something that matched my vision less.
